# Readsr #

Readsr is a web app to track literary (or other kinds) of reading series. The series app tracks series events, which are represented by:

* A collection of information about the series (title, contact, venue, etc.).
* A recurrence rule based on the dateutil package's rrule module.

## How it works ##

Each series can define a recurrence rule that creates one or more occurrences, representing a particular reading at a time and place. These are displayed in a calendar format.

Registered users can create series and modify series that they own. Readsr tweets via @readsr when a series is created or updated in a significant way (new name, venue, time, etc.)

Readsr is an experimental app put together as a way to learn Django, so please use it with caution! If you have suggestions, they are more than welcome. Please submit via issue at https://github.com/sandinmyjoints/readsr.
